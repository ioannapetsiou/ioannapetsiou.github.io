                <p>Journalism is a perilous profession, often marked by significant risks and attacks. The dedication to uncover the truth and inform the public can come at a high cost. The phrase <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33750163/Fair_game_Journalists_experiences_of_online_abuse">"If you can't take the heat, get out of the newsroom"</a> is familiar to many journalists, and it has driven some to leave the profession.

                <p>Among the three types of attacks documented by CPJ, getting killed is the most common threat faced by journalists and media workers. 
                Of those killed, <b> 42% were murdered</b>, all due to their journalism activities. Additionally, 32% were killed in unknown circumstances, 
                14.5% in crossfire, and 11.5% during dangerous assignments.
                Overall, <b><u>nearly three in four of those killed had a confirmed motive</u></b>, indicating they died because of their work.</p>

                <p>However, this is no surpise. Only in the 21st century, the Middle East has experienced 25 different armed conflicts, 
                many of which are still ongoing, while political and social unrest seems to be never-ending. Clearly, this is a geographical region where one war follows another, and one socio-political tension leads to another, resulting in low levels of democracy and justice.</p>
                <p>The Middle East is not the only problem Asia has to face. In 2023, China was 179th in <a href="https://rsf.org/en/country/china"> World's Press Freedom Index</a> (an annual ranking of countries compiled and published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) since 2002 based upon the organization's own assessment of the countries' press freedom records in the previous year). China is often characterized as one of the largest jailer of journalists.</p> 
                <p>It's important to note that totalitarian regimes or conflict-ridden countries may underreport or misrepresent attacks on journalists and media workers. 
                In North America, the ongoing drug war and gang-violence significantly influences the number of reported attacks on journalists and media workers. 
                Journalists who attempt to cover these stories often face threats and attacks, such as the ones mentioned above. 
                However, due to government interests, many of these cases go unreported. Same thing happens in totalitarian countries, where journalists and media workers are considered a threat. </p>
