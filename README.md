# Lede Projects
Here are the html codes for my projects:

This is my [first project](https://ioannapetsiou.github.io/wildfires). It's about wildfires in Greece from 2000 - 2023.

This is my [second project](https://ioannapetsiou.github.io/movies). It's about movie franchise ratings, and whether original films ratings are better than the sequels.

Here you can find the GitHub repository containing the code for the analysis and process notes of the [first project](https://github.com/ioannapetsiou/greece_wildfires) and the [second project](https://github.com/ioannapetsiou/movies_and_franchises).

Thank you for visiting my websites!
