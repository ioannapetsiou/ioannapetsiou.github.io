# Lede Projects
Here are the html codes for my projects:

This is my [first project](https://ioannapetsiou.github.io/wildfires). It's about wildfires in Greece from 2000 - 2023.

This is my [second project](https://ioannapetsiou.github.io/movies). It's about movie franchise ratings, and whether original films ratings are better than the sequels.

This is my [third project](https://ioannapetsiou.github.io/attacks-on-journalists/). It's about attacks towards journalists and media workers worldwide, from 1992 to 2023.

Here you can find the GitHub repository containing the code for the analysis and process notes of the [first project](https://github.com/ioannapetsiou/greece_wildfires), the [second project](https://github.com/ioannapetsiou/movies_and_franchises) and the [third project](https://github.com/ioannapetsiou/attacks_on_journalists).
